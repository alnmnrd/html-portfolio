<H3>Mommy</H3>
<p>Mommy (2014), directed by Xavier Dolan, is a powerful drama that tells the story of Diane “Die” Després, a widowed single mother raising her troubled and violent teenage son, Steve, who has ADHD. After being expelled from a youth institution, Steve returns to live with Die, and their intense, unpredictable relationship is at the core of the film. They form a bond with their introverted neighbor, Kyla, who helps them navigate the chaos in their lives.</p>
<p>The film is notable for its emotional depth, raw performances, and the unique use of a 1:1 aspect ratio, creating a sense of intimacy and confinement. Mommy explores themes of love, mental illness, and the struggles of motherhood, with Dolan’s signature style of blending intensity with tender moments.</p>
<H3>Abre los ojos</H3>
<p>Abre los ojos (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenábar, is a Spanish psychological thriller that follows the life of César, a handsome and wealthy young man who suffers a horrific accident that leaves his face disfigured. His once perfect life unravels as he undergoes reconstructive surgery and struggles with increasingly bizarre and nightmarish experiences. As reality and illusion blur, César becomes trapped in a surreal world of dreams, guilt, and identity, questioning what is real and what is imagined.</p>
<p>The film explores deep themes of love, memory, and the nature of reality, using a complex narrative structure that keeps the audience guessing until the end. It was later remade in Hollywood as Vanilla Sky (2001).</p>
<H3>Les Jolies Choses</H3>
<p>Les Jolies Choses (2001), directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, is a French drama based on the novel by Virginie Despentes. The film revolves around twin sisters Lucie and Marie, both played by Marion Cotillard, who are polar opposites. Lucie is wild and self-destructive, pursuing a career in the music industry, while Marie is more reserved and introspective. After Lucie’s sudden death, Marie steps into her sister’s chaotic life, adopting her identity to find success in Lucie’s place.</p>
<p>As Marie navigates the seductive and treacherous world of fame, she grapples with questions of identity, the objectification of women, and the dark side of the entertainment industry. The film is an intense exploration of self-perception, desire, and the fine line between who we are and who we pretend to be. Marion Cotillard’s dual performance is central to the film’s emotional depth and psychological complexity.</p>
